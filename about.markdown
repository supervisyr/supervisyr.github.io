## whoami
I, the one they call Supervisyr, am a fellow of not much presence. I was advised to get a professional Instagram account so employers would not be put off by my mystery and whimsy, but, man, do I hate Instagram. Here lies, and thrives, my online portfolio. Projects of mine, articles I write, and, hell, I may one day upload whole books here. This site may face migration one day when I become equipped to self-host.

## What is supervisyr.github.io Even About?
supervisyr.github.io is about many things, what they have in common is that they are things I wanted to put out there. Because everything is posted in my interest, much of it will be about mainframe technology, hostile artificial intelligence, strange and unreasonable hardware, straight up malware, not liking Apple, and tech most consider obsolete. Overall, it will contain:
**Projects**: Documentation of various projects I find myself working on. Can be anything from writing a dungeon crawler in COBOL to bizarre PC builds.
**Guides**: Guides, primarily designed for inexperienced users, on specific topics such as handling the Windows 10 EOL, learning Linux, or the annoying process that is 802.1X authentication. 
**Explorations**: Articles on specific computers, operating systems, malware, applications, etc that I find interesting. May contain review-style commentary on different Linux distributions, research papers on ancient viruses, and long-winded rants about advertisements.
**Literature**: I love to write fiction, may write my crypto-technothrillers here one day when I finally sit down and write them.
